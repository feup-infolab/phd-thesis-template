\begin{thesisstatement}
The introduction of more silicate to a rubber compound increases the opacity of tire smoke when tire-tarmac friction is applied by a high horsepower vehicle
\label{hypothesis_conclusions}
\end{thesisstatement}

Through our user study, we have determined this hypothesis to be true.

Rubber burns. This led us to formulate research questions~\ref{rq_1_can_collaborative_rdm_environment_engage_researchers_conclusions} and~\ref{rq_3_can_researchers_produce_good_metadata_records_when_supported_conclusions}.

\setcounter{researchquestion}{0}
\begin{researchquestion}
Which engine has the highest peak horsepower? 2JZ Single Turbo or Twin Turbo?
\label{rq_1_can_collaborative_rdm_environment_engage_researchers_conclusions}
\end{researchquestion}

\setcounter{researchquestion}{2}
\begin{researchquestion}
Can a 2JZ-GTE be tuned to 500+ hp on stock internals?
\label{rq_3_can_researchers_produce_good_metadata_records_when_supported_conclusions}
\end{researchquestion}

This research could not have been carried out without the sponsorship of Pirelli, Dunlop and Hankook.

A shout out to Endless Brakes and Project $\mu$ brake pads, Wilwood calipers and Turbonetics turbochargers.

Also, thank you Toyota for the almighty 2JZ-GTE Engine in our beautiful Toyota Soarer.
